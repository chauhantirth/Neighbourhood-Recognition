# Neighbourhood-Recognition
A simple Machine Learning Project based on K Means Clustering Algorithm to recognize neighbourhood across the provided co-ordinates of a location as dataset. 

## Dataset

- Dataset consist of co-ordinates of the places on the maps along with other details, the two main features 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' are required for mapping.
- The dataset I have used is extracted from [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

## Workflow

- Step 1: Loading the dataset and filtering it
- Step 2: Using Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters

- Step 3: Model Training
- Step 4: Plotting the result
